Machine Learning with Python: Multi-Class Classification & Clustering
Overview

This project explores machine learning techniques using Python as a data science tool. It involves descriptive statistics, supervised and unsupervised learning, and independent evaluation via an in-class Kaggle competition.

Objectives

Data Understanding: Read and describe the dataset using basic statistics.

Data Splitting: Partition the dataset into training and testing subsets.

Classification: Apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) for multi-class classification.

Clustering: Use K-Means to discover patterns in data.

Model Evaluation: Independently evaluate models, simulating real-world ML workflows.

Tools & Techniques

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn – Data wrangling, ML modeling, evaluation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization

Kaggle Competition – Independent model evaluation
